# piscinePython
Create a function called text_analyzer that displays the sums of upper characters, lowercharacters, punctuation characters and spaces in a given text.

text_analyzer will take one parameter: the text to analyze. You should handle the casewhere the text is empty (maybe use a default value). If there is no text passed to the function,the user is prompted to give one.
